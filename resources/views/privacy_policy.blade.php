                        <h5>DISPUTES AND JURISDICTION</h5>
                        <p>All claims brought up by this policy, including but not limited to claims regarding rights, refunds, and compensation, will be resolved using a two-step alternative dispute resolution process. Stage one: mediation. If a dispute arises, an impartial third party will be chosen to settle the issue, and each party will select a mediator for mutual agreement. They may each nominate a sole arbitrator, and if both sides agree to that person, he or she will be assigned to mediate the case. Nevertheless, if the two proposed mediators are unable to reach a consensus, the company reserves the right to make the final decision. In spite of the mediator's decision being non-binding, both parties will do their best to abide by it. Stage 2: the arbitration process. If the mediation is unsuccessful, the arbitration award is final and enforceable by both parties. Two parties will each name one arbitrator, and the third will be appointed by two other arbitrators they mutually select. The arbitration is being held in Dhaka, Bangladesh. English will be used for the arbitration proceedings. After the arbitrator hands down their decision, both parties are bound by it. The case will be brought before the Dhaka court if the alternative dispute resolution fails to resolve the conflict.
